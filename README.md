About me

I’m a computer science student from Kenya, learning by building. I created GwenBooks, a web app that aggregates free books from multiple public APIs so readers can find and read novels seamlessly. I’m exploring web development (Next.js + TypeScript), improving my Java skills, and figuring out where I want to focus long-term.

- Developing **GwenBooks** — a full-stack web app that sources novels from multiple free APIs (Gutenberg, OpenLibrary, Internet Archive) for seamless online reading.
- Strengthening my skills in **Next.js**, TypeScript, and full-stack web development.
- Learning **Java** and exploring backend concepts for building robust systems.

Building and improving GwenBooks — multi-API book search and reader.

Learning Java and strengthening programming fundamentals.

- **Advanced Web Development — Next.js, React, APIs, and Databases (Neon + Drizzle ORM)**
- **Java Programming — mastering OOP and backend logic**
- **
- **Cloud Deployment & DevOps Basics — deploying projects on Vercel and understanding CI/CD**
- **Software Design Principles and clean code architecture**
- **Computer Networking concepts**

⚙️ GwenBooks — quick snapshot

GwenBooks is a lightweight web reader that:

| Project | Description | Tech Stack | Link |
|--------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **GwenBooks** | Multi-API book search, intelligent source fallback, and immersive reading experience | Next.js • TypeScript • Tailwind CSS • Open Library API • Gutenberg API • Internet Archive API • Neon DB • Vercel | gwen-books.vercel.app |
| **Portfolio Website** | My personal website showcasing projects | Next.js, TailwindCSS | myportfolio.vercel.app |
| **Java** | My ongoing Java learning and algorithm practice | Java | null |

Falls back across sources automatically when content is missing.

Provides an in-app reader when plain text is available, or links to the original source when needed.

💬 Values & approach

I prefer learning by building — each project teaches something new.

I aim for honesty in my profile and project descriptions. If something is experimental, I say so.

I care about accessibility, simplicity, and iterative improvement.

“I may not have everything figured out yet — but I’m building, learning, and improving every day.”

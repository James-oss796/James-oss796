About me

I’m a computer science student from Kenya, learning by building. I created GwenBooks, a web app that aggregates free books from multiple public APIs so readers can find and read novels seamlessly. I’m exploring web development (Next.js + TypeScript), improving my Java skills, and figuring out where I want to focus long-term.

🔭 Current focus

Building and improving GwenBooks — multi-API book search and reader.

Learning Java and strengthening programming fundamentals.

Building responsive, accessible interfaces with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

⚙️ GwenBooks — quick snapshot

GwenBooks is a lightweight web reader that:

Searches multiple free book sources (Open Library, Gutenberg, Internet Archive).

Falls back across sources automatically when content is missing.

Provides an in-app reader when plain text is available, or links to the original source when needed.

Try it: https://gwen-books.vercel.app

🛠️ Tech stack (what I use)

Frontend / Fullstack: Next.js • React • TypeScript • Tailwind CSS

APIs: Open Library • Gutenberg (Gutendex) • Internet Archive

DB / Backend: Neon Postgres • Drizzle ORM (experimenting)

Deploy / Hosting: Vercel

💬 Values & approach

I prefer learning by building — each project teaches something new.

I aim for honesty in my profile and project descriptions. If something is experimental, I say so.

I care about accessibility, simplicity, and iterative improvement.

“I may not have everything figured out yet — but I’m building, learning, and improving every day.”
